# Capstone Project 1: Loan Analysis & Prediction

## Abstract
This project aims to develop an efficient data pipeline for loan analysis and prediction by integrating big data engineering, real-time streaming, and machine learning. Leveraging **Databricks, Kafka, and Power BI**, we ensure scalable data processing, insightful visualization, and improved financial decision-making.

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Background
Traditional loan approval systems often suffer from inefficiencies, leading to inaccurate risk assessment and delayed processing. This project introduces a **data-driven approach** using **machine learning and big data technologies** to enhance loan approval decision-making and risk evaluation.

### 1.2 Objectives
- Develop a **scalable data pipeline** for loan data processing.
- Implement **advanced data engineering techniques** to clean and preprocess loan data.
- Train and evaluate multiple **machine learning models** to predict loan approval probability.
- Visualize key financial insights through **interactive Power BI dashboards**.
- Deploy **real-time predictive models** using **Apache Kafka** for seamless loan processing.

---

## 2. Literature Review
To establish a strong theoretical foundation, we explored various **research papers and industry reports** on **loan risk assessment, machine learning applications in finance, and real-time data processing strategies**. The study highlights best practices for optimizing financial decision-making through data-driven insights.

## 3. Methodology
### 3.1 Design & Architecture
The project follows a structured approach:
- **Data Collection:** Loan-related financial datasets sourced from public and private databases.
- **Data Engineering:** Data preprocessing, handling missing values, feature selection, and transformation.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting; fine-tuning the best-performing model.
- **Real-Time Prediction:** Deploying trained ML models using **Apache Kafka** to enable real-time loan approval.
- **Visualization:** Developing **Power BI dashboards** for better financial insights.
- **Integration:** Using **Databricks** for data pipeline scalability.
- **Code Implementation:** ETL, streaming data processing, and inferencing models in a real-time environment with **Databricks**.

## 4. Data Insights & Visualizations
I created various visualizations using **Power BI** to gain insights into loan approval trends and risk factors:

- **Loan Approval Analysis:** Scoreboard representation.
- **Occupation-wise Property Value:** Pie chart analysis.
- **Loan Amount vs. Loan Type:** Horizontal bar chart.
- **Total Units vs. Security Type:** Bar chart.
- **Interest Rate and Loan Purpose Analysis:** Gantt chart.
- **Income vs. Gender:** Donut chart for income distribution.
- **Credit Score vs. Age & Status:** Line plot to understand credit score patterns.

## 5. Conclusion
### 5.1 Summary
This project successfully integrates **big data engineering, machine learning, and visualization tools** to optimize loan assessment. Through **Databricks, Kafka, and Power BI**, we ensure real-time predictions and scalable processing for financial institutions.

### 5.2 Future Work
- Improve **model accuracy** with additional training datasets.
- Expand **data sources** to enhance risk assessment models.
- Deploy the solution in a **real-world financial environment** for further validation.
